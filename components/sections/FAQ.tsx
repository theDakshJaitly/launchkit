    question: "How is this different from other boilerplates?",
    answer:
      "Most boilerplates are just code. LaunchKit includes .cursorrules that teach AI your entire architecture — cutting token usage by 80%. Plus one-command setup and living updates that keep templates current.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work with my Cursor subscription?",
    answer:
      "Yes. It makes your subscription 10x more valuable. Use 50 requests for setup instead of 500. That leaves 450 for actual features. Your monthly limit goes much further.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for client projects?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Unlimited projects, no per-project fees. Build as many client projects as you want with one purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm already halfway through a project?",
    answer:
      "We include migration guides to adopt LaunchKit patterns into existing projects. Gradually improve your codebase without starting over.",
  },
  {
    question: "When does this launch?",
    answer:
      "Late February 2026. Join the waitlist to lock in the 50% discount and get notified the moment we go live.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to know how to code?",
    answer:
      "Basic React and Next.js knowledge helps. If you can use Cursor, you can use LaunchKit. The AI handles the heavy lifting.",
