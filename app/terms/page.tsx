            <p className="mb-3">
              Due to the immediate access nature of digital goods, all sales are final once access to the GitHub repository has been granted. You may request a refund within seventy-two (72) hours of purchase only if you have not yet accepted the GitHub invitation or accessed the source code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pursuant to international consumer rights standards, you hereby provide express prior consent to the immediate performance of this contract and acknowledge that you waive your statutory 14-day right of withdrawal once delivery begins.
